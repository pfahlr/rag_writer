  type: direct
  question: List two therapy modalities that leverage neuroplasticity in stroke or brain-injury rehab.

  answer: "Constraint-induced movement therapy and functional electrical stimulation (also treadmill training with body-weight support and VR therapy show evidence)." :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

- id: Q05
  type: direct
  question: Which neurotrophic factors increase with aerobic exercise and what domains of cognition often improve?
  gold_doc: NP10_exercise_bdnf.md
  answer: "Aerobic exercise elevates BDNF, IGF-1, and VEGF; improvements are seen in spatial memory and executive function, alongside hippocampal and prefrontal gray-matter gains." :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

- id: Q06
  type: ambiguous
  question: Tell me about plasticity from training.
  gold_doc: NP09_meditation_art_music.md
  clarify: Do you mean meditation, artistic training, music therapy, or physical exercise?
  answer: "Meditation, long-term artistic practice, music-supported therapy, and aerobic exercise each induce measurable structural/functional changes in networks supporting attention, emotion, sensorimotor control, and memory." :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

- id: Q07
  type: ambiguous
  question: Explain sensory reassignment.
  gold_doc: NP11_sensory_loss_reassignment.md
  clarify: Should I focus on deafness, blindness, or human echolocation?
  answer: "After sensory loss, deprived cortical regions can be repurposed to process inputs from remaining senses (cross-modal reassignment), as seen when auditory cortex supports vision/touch in deaf individuals or visual cortex supports echo processing in blind echolocators." :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

- id: Q08
  type: synthesis
  question: Contrast structural and functional plasticity and give one example of each.
  gold_docs:
  - NP05_structural_vs_functional.md
  - NP03_synaptic_plasticity_basics.md
  answer: "Structural plasticity involves anatomical change (e.g., gray-matter redistribution/neurogenesis); functional plasticity alters information routing across networks (e.g., cross-modal reassignment or homologous area adaptation). Example structural: hippocampal changes with navigation/learning; example functional: map expansion or sensory reassignment after deprivation." :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

- id: Q09
  type: synthesis
  question: How do meditation and aerobic exercise each relate to brain plasticity?
  gold_docs:
  - NP09_meditation_art_music.md
  - NP10_exercise_bdnf.md
  answer: "Meditation is linked to thicker or denser cortex in attention–emotion circuits and altered functional connectivity; aerobic exercise upregulates BDNF/IGF-1/VEGF, enlarges hippocampal/prefrontal structures, and improves executive control and memory." :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

- id: Q10
  type: synthesis
  question: Summarize the sensitive period concept using the cochlear implant case and connect it to functional reassignment.
  gold_docs:
  - NP14_cochlear_implants_sensitive_period.md
  - NP11_sensory_loss_reassignment.md
  answer: "In prelingually deaf children there’s a sensitive period (~first 2–4 years) when cochlear implantation supports typical language development; outside it, auditory cortex may be repurposed for other modalities—an instance of functional reassignment—reducing implant benefits." :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

- id: Q11
  type: conflict
  question: What proportion of amputees experience phantom limb sensations?
  gold_docs:
  - NP07_phantom_limb.md
  - NP15_conflict_range_example.md
  note: "Expect a range (60–80%) with caveat."
  answer: "Approximately 60–80% of amputees report phantom limb sensations, with phantom pain linked to cortical reorganization (maladaptive plasticity)." :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

- id: Q12
  type: freshness
  question: What is the most up-to-date perspective on adult neurogenesis in humans from this corpus?
  gold_doc: NP05_structural_vs_functional.md
  note: "Answer should reflect 'not convincingly demonstrated in humans' in this corpus."
  answer: "Within this corpus, adult neurogenesis has not been convincingly demonstrated in humans." :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

  type: direct
  question: Give one cognitive benefit observed in multilinguals and one neural correlate.
  gold_doc: NP12_multilingualism.md
  answer: "Benefit: improved executive function/attentional control; neural correlate: increased gray-matter density in the inferior parietal cortex (and, with active use, greater white-matter myelination)." :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

- id: Q16
  type: multiturn
  question: Discuss how plasticity explains recovery after brain injury.
  gold_doc: NP06_applications_rehab.md
  followups:
  - Name one therapy and the likely mechanism.
  - What evidence or limitations are noted?
  answer: "Recovery reflects functional reorganization and recruitment of alternate pathways; targeted, goal-directed training (e.g., CIMT, FES) drives use-dependent cortical remapping and network strengthening, supporting regained function, though mechanisms vary and evidence strength differs by modality." :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

- id: Q17
  type: synthesis
  question: Relate chronic pain and phantom limb phenomena to cortical map reorganization.
  gold_docs:
  - NP08_chronic_pain.md
  - NP07_phantom_limb.md
  answer: "Both involve maladaptive reorganization: persistent nociceptive input and central sensitization distort somatotopic maps in chronic pain, while post-amputation remapping and reduced representation spacing correlate with phantom sensations/pain." :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

- id: Q18
  type: direct
  question: "Mention two key 20th-century figures or experiments that shaped modern views on plasticity."
  gold_doc: NP02_history_milestones.md

  question: Define metaplasticity in one sentence.
  gold_doc: NP03_synaptic_plasticity_basics.md
  answer: "A higher-order plasticity mechanism that adjusts the thresholds and conditions for inducing LTP/LTD—e.g., via NMDA receptor state or calcium buffering—preventing saturation and stabilizing overall activity." :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}

- id: Q20
  type: direct
  question: What term has been proposed for compounds that rapidly promote plasticity with therapeutic benefit for depression?
