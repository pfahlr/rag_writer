  - Section: {{section_title_hierarchy}}
  - Subsection: {{subsection_title}} ({{subsection_id}})

  **Section to Research:** {{section_title}}

  **Requirements:**
  1. Generate exactly {{num_prompts}} different research prompts that explore different aspects of this section
  2. Each prompt should focus on evidence-based research and citation requirements
  3. Include variety: literature review, methodology analysis, evidence evaluation, and research implications
  4. Consider the hierarchical context (chapter > section > subsection)
  5. Ensure prompts emphasize academic rigor and scholarly standards
  6. Make prompts suitable for evidence-based research writing

  **Output Format:**
  Return a JSON array of exactly {{num_prompts}} job objects, each with:
  - "task": Brief description of the researcher's role and focus
  - "instruction": Specific research instruction for this aspect of the section
  - "context": Object with book_title, chapter, section, subsection, subsection_id, target_audience

  Example format:
  [
    {
      "task": "You are a research analyst...",
      "instruction": "Conduct a comprehensive literature review...",
      "context": {
        "book_title": "{{book_title}}",
        "chapter": "{{chapter_title}}",
        "section": "{{section_title_hierarchy}}",
        "subsection": "{{subsection_title}}",

        "target_audience": "{{target_audience}}"
      }
    }
